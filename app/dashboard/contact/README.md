# Contact Us Feature

This feature provides users with contact information for reaching out to the application administrators.

## How It Works

The Contact Us page displays:

1. The primary contact email address
2. A direct link to open the user's email client
3. Guidelines for what to include in the message

## Implementation

- A prominent display of the email address
- A button to open the default email client
- Responsive design that works well on all device sizes
- Dark mode support

## Contact Email

The primary contact email is: samuelaidoo45@gmail.com
